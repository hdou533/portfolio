        <p>I&apos;m Sally, a passionate frontend engineer with a strong foundation in IT. I hold a degree in Information Technology from the University of Auckland, where I honed my skills and developed a deep love for crafting exceptional digital experiences.</p>
        
        <p>When I&apos;m not immersed in the world of coding, you&apos;ll catch me hanging out in my garden, getting my hands dirty and loving every bit of it. Lately, I&apos;ve also been all about pottery â€“ there&apos;s something oddly satisfying about shaping clay into cool stuff. Oh, and anime? Yep, I&apos;m totally into that too. Whether I&apos;m tweaking a website or binge-watching a new anime series, I&apos;m all about embracing the awesome variety life has to offer!</p>
